Project Statement:
For my final project, I decided to create a resource site for my club (The MSU Smash Ultimate Club). This site is managed through Gatsby and Yarn. I wanted my site to include 3 data resourses being: Start.gg Api (to collect tournament results), Leaflet Api (to map out the location of our events), and Supabase (to show projected ranking of top players for the season). However, having 3 data resources would become a huge hassel, so I decided to narrow it down to two being Start.gg and Leaflet. I also used the Bootstrap framework to make any aesthetic changes. I added my Wireframe-comp as a folder called "Preproduction" 

My Work: 
1. https://github.com/allanand/final3
2. https://msusu.netlify.app/ -As I mention below, this is very outdated version of my project. I was unable to deploy a majority of my changes to Netlify. My Github Repo has all of the working code for a local enivroment.  

Personal Note:
1. I had difficulty parsing the Start.gg data I wanted, so I had to use Stringify (so it might look a lot more messy then it was during office hours). 
2. Leaflet has a bizarre bug where you have to go full screen or windowed in your browser for the map to center. 
3. I was unable to get my repo to deploy to Netlify. I spent close to 10 hours on the task and have ran out of ideas or options. I have linked my latest working version of the site, however, it is very outdated and only really includes Leaflet.
